## Project Overview
This report is part of semestral work for subject Ethical hacking of the Information Security program on FIT, CTU.  
The focus is to assert skills gained during the semester as well as use them in real-world scenario. The website [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) has been chosen for this purpouse as it offers a [bug bounty](https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team) and is therefore eligible for ethical hackers to try and hack.  

<!-- Page break -->
<!-- <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> -->
<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->

## Scope Description
We will be focusing on the web application on domain twitter.com.  
While the bug bounty posted by twitter puts some vulnerabilities out scope for financial reward, we will still be trying to perform these attacks as to deepen our ethical hacking skills.

<!-- Page break -->
<!-- <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> -->
<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->

## Pentesting Methodology
<!-- https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/ -->
As a pentesting methodology we have chosen the [OWASP Web Application Security Testing guide - version 4.2](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/), which is the latest stable version. To be more precise, we will be covering following topics:
  - Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
  - Identity Management Testing
  - Authentication Testing
  - Authorization Testing
  - Session Management Testing
  - Input Validation Testing
  - Testing for Error Handling
  - Testing for Weak Cryptography
  - Business Logic Testing
  - Client-side Testing

<!-- Page break -->
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->

## Scoring System
We will be using the widely used [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) standard for evaulating the threat levels of vulnerabilities found in this report. In particular we will use the CVSS 3.1 version. The standard defines multiple metrics (base, temporal, environmental), however we will use only the base metric since we are performing a one-time pentesting as external entity so the temporal and environmental metrics are not that important and available to us.  
We will be scoring each vulnerability on several factors such as access complexity, confidentiality impact, integrity impact and others, to calculate the final score. This will determine the final rating of that vulnerability as seen in the following table.  

<!-- CSS for scoring table-->
<style>
.scoring_table {
  width: 100%;
  border: 2px solid;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

tr:nth-child(even) {

}

th {
  border-bottom: 2px solid;
  text-align: center;
}

td {

</style>

# Pre-engagement
## Threat Model
Twitter does not openly disclose how its backend communication works.  
Since twitter is a web application it is obviously exposed to the internet which naturally puts it in proximity of multitude of threats. On top of that it is definitely an attractive target for hackers, since it stores personal information of about 350 million people.  
Some vulnerable points might be the client-server-database communication for authentication or tweets being stored in database and showing to completely random users' feeds.

<!-- Page break -->
<!-- <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> -->
<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->

## Intelligence-gathering Outcomes
Firstly we ran port scan with **nmap**. We used the following command to find the open ports and possibly the version of service running on them:  
```nmap -sV twitter.com```  
![nmap -sV output](assets/preengagement/nmap_version.png)  

Full output can be seen in *outputs/nmap_version.txt*.     
We can see that there are two open tcp ports (80, 443).

We then ran **nmap** with intention to determine the OS running, version and traceroute with:  
```nmap -A twitter.com```  
![nmap -A output 1](assets/preengagement/nmap_output2.png)  

![nmap -A output 2](assets/preengagement/nmap_output1.png)  
Full output can be seen in *outputs/nmap_A.txt*.   
Here it is specified that on port 80 there is http running. Also all requests sent are returned with HTTP 400 so service as well as OS could not be recognized.

Then we ran **dnsenum** to try and gather some infromation about the domain:  
```dnsenum --enum twitter.com```  
![ dnsenum output ](assets/preengagement/dnsenum_output.png)  
Full output can be seen in *outputs/dnsenum.txt*.     
Which listed us a lot of subdomains and IP addresses of twitter.


As stated before the twitter developers don't share much information about twitter.
However through developer [blog](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/) they sometimes discuss what actually happens on twitter's backend. Through that we were able to find out that twitter used to run on MySQL database, but has switched to distributed database NoSQL system called Manhattan, that is custom developed for twitter. Manhattan itself utilizes multiple open-source technologies like Apache Cassandra or Hadoop. This information might prove useful for performing some SQL Injection attacks. 

As for the front-end part of Twitter it mostly consists of HTML, CSS and Javascript, particularly React.js. Of those, React.js is obviously the one to be concentrated on when pentesting. Some of its most common vulnerabilities are Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, Cross-site request forgery, Vulnerability in packages and dependencies, Broken authentication, Zip slip or XML external entities.

Last but not least we tried so called Google Hacking/Dorking but it didn't disclose any important information.

# Testing process

## 4.1 Information Gathering

This topic is covered in the [Pre-engagement section](#pre-engagement).

<!-- Page break -->
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->

## 4.2 Configuration and Deployment Management Testing

### 4.2.1 Test Network Infrastructure Configuration

As we don't have access to neither used systems nor any configuration files, this test cannot be performed.


### 4.2.2 Test Application Platform Configuration

We ran `dirb` to scan for sample and known files and directories.  
<img src="assets/configuration_and_deployment_management_testing/dirb_known_files.png" alt=" Dirb known files output"><br>
All of the requests were valid endpoints, redirections, account names or the Twitter's custom "Page was not found" page.


### 4.2.3 Test File Extensions Handling for Sensitive Information

For this test we ran `dirb` again, but this time with file extensions wordlist. It didn't disclose any new files or pages.  
<img src="assets/configuration_and_deployment_management_testing/dirb_extensions.png" alt="Dirb file extensions output"><br>


### 4.2.4 Review Old Backup and Unreferenced Files for Sensitive Information

We haven't found neither endpoints nor functions suitable for inference from the naming scheme.

When reviewing the front-end source code, no useful comments were found.

Blind guessing was performed in the previous sections with no success.


### 4.2.5 Enumerate Infrastructure and Application Admin Interfaces

We weren't able to reveal any admin interface.


### 4.2.6 Test HTTP Methods

Running `nmap`  with http-methods script disclosed that only reasonable HTTP methods are allowed.  
<img src="assets/configuration_and_deployment_management_testing/nmap_http_methods.png"><br>


### 4.2.7 Test HTTP Strict Transport Security

<!-- maybe a vulnerability?? -->
HTTP Strict Transport Security header is included in the response. However it lacks the includeSubDomains directive and since there are public subdomains such as [blog.twitter.com](blog.twitter.com) or [about.twitter.com](about.twitter.com) and none of them probably require usage of unsecured http, the includeSubDomains directive should be included as well.  
<img src="assets/configuration_and_deployment_management_testing/curl_hsts.png"><br>


### 4.2.8 Test RIA Cross Domain Policy

Neither crossdomain.xml nor clientaccesspolicy.xml are accessible.

 
### 4.2.9 Test File Permission

We don't have access to any web server, so we cannot inspect the local file permissions. No online directories were found.


### 4.2.10 Test for Subdomain Takeover

`dnsrecon` found no records and therefore no records suitable for takeover.  
<img src="assets/configuration_and_deployment_management_testing/dnsrecon.png"><br>

### 4.2.11 Test Cloud Storage

abs.twimg.com seems to be a cloud service but it only provides public content such as tweets, additional javascript code, emoji and CSS for the client web application so the authorization for reading is not required. Updating the file was not successful.  
<img src="assets/configuration_and_deployment_management_testing/curl_cloud_put.png"><br>


<!-- Page break -->
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->

## 4.3 Identity Management Testing
### 4.3.1 Test Role Definitions
Since the application is being tested as a black-box from a normal user standpoint we don't have information about available roles. Even after looking throught HTTP communication any specific roles
could not be identified. Therefore we are not able to test roles layout or permissions.  

### 4.3.2 Test User Registration Process
User can register using several different options (with Google/Apple account or native) we will test native registration process as the other two are using different applications and are out of scope.  
<img src="assets/identity_management/register_options.png" alt="Regsitration options" width="50%" height="50%">  

The requirments for registration are name, email and date of birth of user. Out of these options only email can be verified. Name can be anything and does not need to be unique, date of birth can be set to anything as it is not verified either.  
<img src="assets/identity_management/register_user_info.png" alt= "User data" width="50%" height="50%">  

In next step user is asked for different permissions which may be granted but are not required.  
<img src="assets/identity_management/register_permissions.png" alt=" Registration permissions " width="50%" height="50%">

In next step user information is confirmed (Notice that date of birth really does not matter as in the example the user's age is 5 years and email is checked in prior stages).  
<img src="assets/identity_management/register_confirmation.png" alt=" Confirm Registration " width="50%" height="50%">  

Next user is prompted to input the code sent to him via email (6 digits). Last step is the creation of password which is described in detail in [authentication testing](#44-authentication-testing)  
In summary anyone with access to an email can create twitter account. Registrations are granted automatically after confirmig email validity. As long as one has access to a valid email
he can register as many times as he can (for purposes of testing we created 5+ accounts with throwaway emails). Users can only register with basic user permissions and the only proof of
identity is email verification.  

### 4.3.4 Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account
It is quite easy to enumerate emails of accounts either when registrating (already used emails inform the user that email is used) or when trying to log in - when using valid email user is redirected to
input his password and when invalid email (not used in registration of any account yet) the following message is shown: *`Sorry, we could not find your account.`* also a HTTP response **400 Bad Request** is sent. 
When we have a valid email we are either redirected and can enter password or if suspicious activity is detected (Login from different location/multiple bad password/username guesses) we are redirected to
input our username. This makes it more difficult to enumerate and brute force users since we need to know username+email to even be able to try passwords. However we still get 5-15 chances before lock-out to try usernames which
can be bruteforced with a bit of educated guess like using name from email or that name + some numbers etc. When wrong username is input page shows message `Incorrect, please try again.` and **400 Bad Request** is sent, user is
then redirected to the same page to try again on a correct username guess we are redirected to input password with **200 OK** response. Note that usernames can be seen by any logged in users - every twitter user has his username on his profile
and under every tweet as `@<username>` - and everyone can become user and therefore see usernames. So we can actually get all information needed to try to brutforce passwords if we are able to connect an account to it's email.
For example I used this method to get back access to a testing account I created and forgot the username of, because twitter appended some random numbers to it (as shown below). Another example is if we got the email used for registration of say Elon Musk (username @elonmusk) we could use this information to effectively lock him out of his twitter account or try to bruteforce his password. It is possible to enumerate user emails and potentially their usernames.  
<img src="assets/identity_management/enumeration_username.png" alt=" Username of account " width="50%" height="50%">

### 4.3.5 Testing for Weak or Unenforced Username Policy
When promted to set username, twitter by default fills the username field with first part of mail and if ambiguous apends some numbers. User can change his username to anything he pleases as long as it is unique across the application. 
So the usernames are implicitly structured but in reality can not be guessed with certainty as users can change them.

<!-- ======================================================================================================================================================== -->
<!-- Style to center all images -->

## 4.4 Authentication Testing
### 4.4.1 Testing for Credentials Transported over an Encrypted Channel  
Twitter uses TLSv1.2 for data transfer encryption and HTTPS for all communication including login, user creation and password change, it can not be forced to 
use unsecure HTTP.  
<img src="assets/authentication/login_wireshark.png" alt=" Wireshark login "><br>
Communication capture of login via Wireshark.  

### 4.4.2 Testing for Default Credentials  
While testing different credentials in the register page I found out there are users with admin@twitter.com and guest@twitter.com registered.  
<img src="assets/authentication/mail_admin.png" alt=" Mail admin "><br>
<img src="assets/authentication/mail_guest.png" alt=" Mail guest "><br>
Twittter indeed uses @twitter.com address (for example registering verification mail is sent from verification@email.com) and they [state](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/fake-twitter-emails)
it as official way of communication,  
<img src="assets/authentication/mail_address.png" alt=" Mail address "><br>
however there is no way of knowing if they are actual twitter.com default/admin credentials, they can however be used to lock out these accounts as described below.  

### 4.4.3 Testing for Weak Lock Out Mechanism  
Twitter's lock out mechanism activates after 5-15 (scales with repeating tries) unsuccessful entries of password/username. Any following tries result in the following message.  
<img src="assets/authentication/lock_out_message.png" alt=" Lock-out message " width="50%" height="50%"><br>
Unlock mechanism is time-based with time-out of 30+ minutes (Twitter [officially states](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/locked-out-after-too-many-login-attempts)
it is an hour lock-out, my first lock-out was shorter though).
<img src="assets/authentication/lock_out_desribe.png" alt=" Lock-out Information "><br>
It also provides possibility to send a form with login issue, but none of the possibilities fit nor help with the lock out issue.  
<img src="assets/authentication/login_issue_form.png" alt=" Login issue form "><br>
If twitter suspects an unusual login activity (lot of bad tries/new location) it prompts the user to input their username or phone, this can also be used to lock-out an account,
as it uses same policy as password lock-out mechanism.  
<img src="assets/authentication/suspicious_activity_precaution.png" alt=" Suspicious activity " width="50%" height="50%"><br>

### 4.4.4 Testing for Bypassing Authentication Schema  
It is not possible to bypass authentication through direct page request. It is possible to visit someones profile with `twitter.com/<username>`, however this does not
disclose any personal/secret information as it shows someone's profile (what it shows depends on individual's account security settings).  
Session IDs look random, they have some similar parts but their value changes unpredictably each login even in concurrent sessions.  

### 4.4.5 Testing for Vulnerable Remember Password  
The login page does not offer 'remember password' functionality and it does not store user's credentials instead replacing them with secure tokens like sessionID.  
<img src="assets/authentication/login_form.png" alt=" Login form " width="50%" height="50%"></p>

### 4.4.6 Testing for Browser Cache Weaknesses  
Attacker can not access private information with the 'History' function and 'Back' button, he gets redirected to secure version of that page where he acts as a guest account or to login page to get authorized.  
The website uses HTTP directives to secure cache correctly with the following settings (copied from response headers).  
<img src="assets/authentication/cache_settings.png" alt=" Cache HTTP settings "><br>
Twitter stores a lot of information in cache, it does so securely and no information can be gathered from the cache. The cache can be viewed by using URL `about:cache` on Firefox.    
<img src="assets/authentication/cache_storage.png" alt=" Browser Cache "></p>

### 4.4.7 Testing for Weak Password Policy
Password policy allows any type of character found on standard keyboard. It requires at least 8 characters and accepts 128 most. It does not force numbers or special characters
but a short password without those will be marked as weak and not accepted. The passwords are checked against common passwords so passwords like `princess` or `password` or `iloveyou` 
will not be allowed, however adding a number to them will 'fix' this so passwords like `princess1` or `password1234` work. General password entropy is not calculated as passwords like `aaaaaaaab`
are also accepted. During registration user can choose password same as his chosen name but if he tries to change a password to his username later via the 'Change your password' function as logged user
password with his username will be rejected (part of it with numbers is okay though). Username is not rejected during registration before user picks his username after creating password. At least for consistency stake it would be best to choose username and then password so it can be checked like in change password functionality. It is not required to confirm password which made me accidentaly enter and submit password I was not yet intending to
use and therefore did not know it when trying to log in again forcing me to reset password.  

User is not forced to change his password after any period of time and he can change his password whenever he pleases with different methods. Change password function requires previous password knowledge. 
The changed passwords can be very similar to previous, it is not allowed to change to same password though. Also the warning messages are different from those seen during registration, if we use common 
password (princess/password) we are presented with *`That password is too easy to guess. Please choose a stronger password.`* while in registration the message was just *`Please enter a stronger password`*. 
Registration phase allows *`show password`* function while *`change password`* function does not.  

<img src="assets/authentication/passwd_example1.png" alt=" Password example 1 " width="50%" height="50%">
<img src="assets/authentication/passwd_example2.png" alt=" Password example 2 " width="50%" height="50%">

<img src="assets/authentication/passwd_example6.png" alt=" Password example 6 " width="50%" height="50%">  
<br>

As mentioned before twitter does not force pretty much any requirements for the password although they provide tips for password strenght in their [Help center](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/account-security-tips)
<img src="assets/authentication/passwd_tips.png" alt=" Password Tips " width="50%" height="50%"></p>

### 4.4.8 Testing for Weak Security Question Answer  
Twitter does not use security question functionality.  

### 4.4.9 Testing for Weak Password Change or Reset Functionalities  
Logged in users can change their passwords with method described under [Testing for Weak Password Policy](#447-testing-for-weak-password-policy) using their current password.  
If user is not logged in he can reset his password via the *`Forgot password?`* functionality. If unusual activity is detected user is prompted to input their username (As described in above subsections), meaning password of
disclosed users (for example previously found admin@twitter.com) cannot be reset. Otherwise user is asked to select email to send verification code to (the code seems to be 8 lenght randomly generated digit-letter sequence).
After inputing the correct code user can change his password. The password policy to new password as well as warning messages are the same as when registrating with new password, this time however it is reqiuired to repeat the password.
When the password is reset user is prompted to enter reason for changing password and is logged out of all active Twitter sessions, as stated in Twitter's [Help Center](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/forgotten-or-lost-password-reset).

### 4.4.10 Testing for Weaker Authentication in Alternative Channel  
No alternative channels are in our scope (mobile/desktop app).

## 4.5 Authorization Testing
### 4.5.1 Testing Directory Traversal File Include
Twitter does not use GET arguments to load files, arguments are rather used to specify settings. Values in cookies are encoded and most likely are not used for dynamic page generation. Attack is therefore not possible.  
<img src="assets/authorization/get_request.png" alt=" GET request " height="50%" width="50%">  

### 4.5.2 Testing for Bypassing Authorization Schema
As we are again testing in black-box setting, we can only test with user privileges/role. For the same reason we can only test for horizontal bypassing.  
Twitter does not identify users by parameter but rather with combination of the right cookie + csrf token and header. So by changing the cookie of one users request with cookie from others gets the response 403 Forbidden and error message with code 353: `This request requires a matching csrf cookie and header.`  
By changing both csrf token and cookie we can get the response of other user but by that we authorized ourselves as that user so that is correct behaviour (getting this information would require to catch communication and decode cookie and csrf token). Horizontal bypassing is not possible.  

### 4.5.3 Testing for Privilege Escalation
Privileges on twitter website are most likely stored in the `auth_token` part of cookie as a hash. No other variables store or allow manipulation in HTTP communication.  
No file with missing or bad authorization checking were found by URL traversal.   

### 4.5.4 Testing for Insecure Direct Object References
Again twitter loads page contents via POST/GET graphQL requests (`POST /i/api/graphql/eB2SB0qYfesXNLf9joi-_w/HomeTimeline`) to api that return the needed content so there is no possible input for object/content manipulation.

### 4.6.2 Testing for Cookies Attributes

Attribute secure is used for all authentication related cookies. However few authentication cookies have the attribute SameSite set to None which may lead to cookie hijacking in case of CSRF/XSS vulnerability.


### 4.6.3 Testing for Session Fixation

The cookie _twitter_sess is set before the authentication and it remains the same after successful authentication. When that _twitter_sess value is set to another user it doesn't make them authenticated as the original one, probably because there are many cookies used in combination for the authentication. 


### 4.6.4 Testing for Exposed Session Variables

Session cookie has its own different value for every session. Protection from eavesdropping is ensured by HTTPS protocol.  

When the _twitter_sess cookie is set, it comes with cache-control directives (apart from others) `no-cache` and `no-store` which prevent it from being cached.  
<img src="assets/session_management_testing/session_cookie_cache_control.png" alt="session cookie cache control"><br>

After reviewing the client-server communication the session cookie seems to be contained only in POST requests.


### 4.6.5 Testing for Cross Site Request Forgery

CSRF Token is included in the _twitter_sess cookie and also as a HTTP header X-Csrf-Token in requests, which prevents the application from being vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery.


### 4.6.6 Testing for Logout Functionality

The logout button is placed in an area of the page that is fixed in the view port of the browser and isn't affected by scrolling of the content. However the logout button cannot be seen directly as user first has to click on the three dots next to his account name and then choose the logout button from the menu that pops out.  

<img src="assets/session_management_testing/account_options_logout_button.png" alt="account options logout button"><br>
<img src="assets/session_management_testing/logout_button.png" alt="logout button"><br>

Note that user cannot log out within the user interface before they answer the cookie related dialog.  

<img src="assets/session_management_testing/cookie_dialog_hidden_logout_button.png" alt=""><br>

If one is logged out and tries to load a page that is only available to authenticated users with their old session cookies, the application sends a response that something went wrong.  

<img src="assets/session_management_testing/invoke_logged_out_session.png" alt="invoke old session"><br>


### 4.6.7 Testing Session Timeout

During the testing process I haven't experienced a single timeout, therefore the only time limit appears to be the expiry date of cookies.


### 4.6.8 Testing for Session Puzzling

All session variables seem to be correctly regenerated for every session and no session puzzling was detected.


### 4.6.9 Testing for Session Hijacking

The application runs on HTTPS, uses HSTS and all cookies related to session or authentication are marked as secure.

## 4.8 Testing for Error Handling
### 4.8.1 Testing for Improper Error Handling
When testing for possible attack vectors we found out that the page responds correctly (with 404 (Not found) or 401 (Unauthorized)) when sending GET/POST requests
to random files or files higher in the hierarchy. Trying different requests (HEAD/DELETE...) returns 405 (Method not allowed). When trying a really long path we recieve `RST_STREAM error 0x2 (Implementation fault)` which doesn't seem to be
an issue on twitter's side but isn't really documented either.  
Another testing was performed by messing with POST and GET parameters. The following GET request parameter `supports_ntab_urt` returns different responses:  
`GET /i/api/2/badge_count/badge_count.json?supports_ntab_urt=1 HTTP/2`  
- 1 / true -> OK 200  
- 2 / abcd -> BAD REQUEST 400 (body of response: `{"errors":[{"code":358,"message":"Unable to parse supports_ntab_urt parameter."}]}`)  
- 0 / false -> Internal Server Error 500  (body of response: `{"errors":[{"message":"Internal error","code":131}]}`)  
Which looks well defined and other tests did not find any unsuspected/improper behaviour.

## 4.9 Testing for Weak Cryptography

### 4.9.1 Testing for Weak Transport Layer Security

We ran `sslscan --show-sigs --verbose twitter.com`. You can see the full output in outputs/sslscan.txt.

The application only supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.

No ciphers that aren't considered secure nowadays are supported.

The SSL Certificate has signature ecdsa-with-SHA384 with key strength 128 bit, signed by DigiCert and is valid for 366 days.

<img src="assets/testing_for_weak_cryptography/sslscan_supported_ciphers.png" alt="supported ciphers"><br>


### 4.9.2 Testing for Padding Oracle

Session and authentication related cookies are encrypted but aren't multiples of 8/16 which implies that a stream cipher was used, and therefore it doesn't meet the requirements for possibility of the Padding Oracle vulnerability.


### 4.9.3 Testing for Sensitive Information Sent via Unencrypted Channels

All data is sent via HTTPS.


### 4.9.4 Testing for Weak Encryption

`sslscan` didn't find any weak encryption on the transport layer.

As we don't have access to the back-end source code we cannot determine which algorithms are used for the encryption that happens on the server side (password hashes, authentication cookies etc.).
